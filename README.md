# Portfolio V3

Welcome to my (Kendall Swanson) portfolio! 

I have created a mockup porfolio that will be used to highlight my skills and web development projects. 

In this version of the porfolio, I have utilized flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to create my website's backbone that I can continue to build on as I add more skills to my repertoire. I incorporsated the handy Bootstrap library to assist in the responsiveness of the website design.
